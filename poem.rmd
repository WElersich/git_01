Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements  
The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of,  
How princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.  
Oft Scyld the Scefing from scathers in numbers  
From many a people their mead-benches tore.  
Since first he found him friendless and wretched,  
The earl had had terror: comfort he got for it,  
Waxed ’neath the welkin, world-honor gained,  
Till all his neighbors o’er sea were compelled to  
Bow to his bidding and bring him their tribute:  
An excellent atheling! After was borne him  
A son and heir, young in his dwelling,  
Whom God-Father sent to solace the people.  
He had marked the misery malice had caused them,  
That reaved of their rulers they wretched had erstwhile  
Long been afflicted. The Lord, in requital,  
Wielder of Glory, with world-honor blessed him.  
Famed was Beowulf, far spread the glory  
Of Scyld’s great son in the lands of the Danemen.
